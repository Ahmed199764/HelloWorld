# Introducation
## In order to explain Git, we have to first explain various aspects of Version Control.
## Version Control: Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes.

### what is Git?
1. Tracking Changes
2. Snapshots
3. Local Operations
4. Loss of Data
5. States

## the status.
1.committed
we store the data in a local database

2.Modified
you have made changes on the data but still you didnt commit it
3.Staged
the statues will be change.

## Cloning
create a new copy of a Git repository.
the santax is :
git clone https://github.com/test

## Local Repository Structure

Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
Index: The area used for staging
Head: Points to the most recent commit
we can check the file status by :
$ git status
##Pushing Changes
git push origin master.
##Remote Repositores
to collaborate on Git projects, you must interact with remote repositories,
versions of a project residing online or on a network. You can work with multiple repositories,
for which you can make some privileges. Teams can use remote
repositories to push information to and pull data from.
the santax is git remote -v.

## This exercie teached me how edit my code from my desktop then push it into git hub.
